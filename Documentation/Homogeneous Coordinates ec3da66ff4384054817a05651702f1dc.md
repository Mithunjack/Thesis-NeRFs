# Homogeneous Coordinates

In mathematics, **homogeneous coordinates** or **projective coordinates** is a system of coordinates used in projective geometry, as Cartesian coordinates used in Euclidean geometry. It is a coordinate system that algebraically treats all points in the projective plane (both Euclidean and ideal) equally.

Suppose we have a point (x,y) in the Cartesian coordinates. To represent this same point in the homogeneous coordinates, we simply add a third coordinate of 1 at the end: (x,y,1).

If the homogeneous coordinates of a point are multiplied by a non-zero scalar then the resulting coordinates represent the same point.

For example, the point (1.4, -1.6) in Cartesian coordinates is the same as:

- (1.4, -1.6, 1)
- or (2.8, -3.2, 2)
- or (0.7, -0.8, 0.5)
- or even (1400, -1600, 1000) in homogeneous coordinates.

One of the advantages of homogeneous coordinates is that they allow for an easy combination of multiple transformations by concatenating several matrix-vector multiplications.
