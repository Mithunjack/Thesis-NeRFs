# Neural Radiance Fields

A [neural radiance field](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.08934) (NeRF) is a fully-connected neural network that can generate novel views of complex 3D scenes, based on a partial set of 2D images. It is trained to use a rendering loss to reproduce input views of a scene. It works by taking input images representing a scene and interpolating between them to render one complete scene. NeRF is a highly effective way to generate images for synthetic data.

A NeRF network is trained to map directly from viewing direction and spatial location (5D input) to opacity and color (4D output), using volume rendering to render new views. NeRF is a computationally-intensive algorithm, and processing of complex scenes can take hours or days. However, new algorithms are available that dramatically improve performance.

# ****Synthetic Data****

Synthetic data is any information manufactured artificially which does not represent events or objects in the real world. Algorithms create synthetic data used in model datasets for testing or training purposes. The synthetic data can mimic operational or production data and help train machine learning (ML) models or test out mathematical models.

Synthetic data offers several important benefits: it minimizes the constraints associated with the use of regulated or sensitive data, it can be used to customize data to match conditions that real data does not allow, and it can be used to generate large training datasets without requiring manual labeling of data.
