# View Synthesis

View synthesis is the opposite of volume renderingâ€”it involves creating a 3D view from a series of 2D images. This can be done using a series of photos that show an object from multiple angles, create a hemispheric plan of the object, and place each image in the appropriate place around the object. A view synthesis function attempts to predict the depth given a series of images that describe different perspectives of an object.
