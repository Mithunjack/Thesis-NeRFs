# 3D deep learning

Traditionally, modelling 3D objects has required 3D scanning techniques such as structure from motion and triangulation that imposes constraints on either the motion of the object, the camera or both[5]. Such camera setups can be both expensive and challenging in remote and hostile outdoor environments[4].

In contrast, ***deep learning based 3D reconstruction methods allow the reconstruction of 3D models only using 2D images, and in some cases a single 2D image, simplifying the process of modelling 3D objects.***  For instance, thanks to these image-to-3D reconstructions you are now able to estimate your body weight using a 2D image from your mobile phone[8]. This demonstrates how 3D deep learning has removed the need for sophisticated depth measuring cameras and setups to build accurate 3D models.
