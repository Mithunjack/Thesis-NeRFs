\chapter{Abstract}\label{ch:Abstract}

This thesis is dedicated to improving the reconstruction of 3D images from 2D Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) data, utilizing Advanced Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF). The main goal is to enhance image quality and denoising capabilities, tackling the inherent challenges in TEM image processing. The research identifies and addresses a significant limitation of NeRF's application in this context, which can potentially make NeRF an ineffective approach. To counter this, we have adopted an architectural framework that integrates multiple NeRF models with a blend of traditional and advanced denoising techniques to improve image quality. Our findings show marked improvements in the quality of TEM images, supported by enhanced evaluation metrics.
